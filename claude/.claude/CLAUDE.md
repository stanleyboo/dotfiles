- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

- Use comments as memory anchors - concise reminders for complex logic, not obvious explanations

## PR comments

<pr-comment-rule>
When I say to add a comment to a PR with a TODO on it, use 'checkbox' markdown format to add the TODO. For instance:
<example>
- [ ] A description of the todo goes here
</example>
</pr-comment-rule>

-When tagging Claude in GitHub issues, use '@claude'

## GitHub

- Your primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI

## Git

- When creating branches, prefix them with feat/ fix/ chore/ whatever appropriate.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
